Hooks
 - allow the use of functional components 
 - they are much cleaner
 - allow hooking into reacts state
 - allows lifecycle methods
 - now with hookos you can do most things
 - the hooks are as follows:
 - useState, useEffect  (mimic lifestyle compDid/compWill)
 - userContext (makes it easier to bring context into your code), useReducer ( allows to create a nice redux reducer without having to use redux) 
 - useRef (gives us cleaner way to deal with refs)
